# KRIME_KIT
Android Easy to Use ADB commands with Graphic User Interface, including SCRCPY.

--HOW TO INSTALL--
Run the KRIME_SETUP.exe and finish the installation wizard.

This is my first ever complete, working project. So yes, it is basic. But all the commands work :)
I need help with the logs text box, I don't know why it is not working :')
